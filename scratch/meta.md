# Mission

Critique and improve code challenge

## Goals

* Reveal working profile of developer:
  * Who are they? (Ask Lucas what he has in mind)
  * Strengths?
  * Weaknesses?
  * Level?

* Don't burden developer. Respect their time.

* Communicate:
  * who we are as a company
  * what our technology is about

* _I would add_
  * be fun
  * screen out problem developers
  * improve acceptance rates

## About current version

The current version has a lot of text not to add complexity and/or
difficulty, but to add clarity and be helpful. (Has the current
version gotten longer over time in response to questions from folks
who have taken the challenge?) The amount of text isn't necessarily
a problem.
