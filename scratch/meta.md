# Mission

Critique and improve code challenge

## Goals

* Reveal working profile of developer:
  * Who are they? (Ask Lucas what he has in mind)
  * Strengths?
  * Weaknesses?
  * Level?

* Don't burden developer. Respect their time.

* Communicate:
  * who we are as a company
  * what our technology is about

* _I would add_
  * be fun
  * screen out problem developers (this could fall under 'working profile')
  * improve acceptance rates

## About current version

The current version has a lot of text not to add complexity and/or difficulty,
but to add clarity and be helpful. (Has the current version gotten longer over
time in response to questions from folks who have taken the challenge?) The
amount of text isn't necessarily a problem.

## Quotes from the job description

...headless components of our music API, including:

* Crawling Discogs, Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Musicbrainz, etc
* Downloading, categorizing, reformatting huge batches of artist images
* Creating public web APIs
* Searching our data store using Elastic Search and/or Postgres
* Calling various social media and music APIs
* Architectural improvements for speed and stability at scale

...heterogenous bag of tools including Scala, Node, and Hadoop, as well as
Rails. We're trying to move all that into Ruby, and preferably Rails.

If you live in the shell, youâ€™re probably already familiar with the tools on
our workbench, e.g. git, REST, JSON, Mongo, Postgres, Jenkins, nginx, gems, and
AWS.
