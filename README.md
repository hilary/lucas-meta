On call is happy, cats are fed, life is dealt with, sitting down to look at the
challenge.

I'm going to keep running notes as I go, to help me return to a less informed
mindset w/re the challenge.

I set up a workspace:

    README.md
    src/
      meta_challenge.txt (Lucas's email)
      challenge.txt      (text of the challenge)
    scratch/    (to think aloud about each of the above)
      meta.md
      challenge.md

I decided to track changes in git, because what else would I use? Created
the repo locally and commited.
