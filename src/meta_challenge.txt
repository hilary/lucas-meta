Hi Hilary,

Code challenge enclosed. Your mission is to critique and improve it.

Our goals are:

* Learn about the working profile of the developer. Who are they? Where do
they excel, where are they weak? How skilled are they?
* Not burden the developer. Consume no more of their time than necessary.
* Communicate who we are as a company and what our technology is about.

Don't take the sheer amount of text here as a problem. It's to add clarity
and be helpful, not to add complexity and difficulty. Or do take it as a
problem!

Keep in touch as you're going along. Feel free to ask questions, ping,
whatever.

Hope you enjoy the project. See you Monday at 10.

-Lucas
